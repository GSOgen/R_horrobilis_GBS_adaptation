The Files_CSV folder includes the .VCF files for two separate disturbed landscapes. Each one counts a different number of individuals and a different number of populations of the species *R. horribillis*.

Added two named .vcf files:

P1_rh_clean.vcf
P2_rh_clean.vcf

These files include the genotypic information of the species *R. horribillis* in the two study landscapes to be analyzed.

*NOTE: these files will not be uploaded because they are data that cannot be made public yet.
